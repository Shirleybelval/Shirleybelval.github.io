          <h2>Random Facts</h2>
          <p>*My dream vacation destinations are Greece, Kenya, and Barcelona</P>
          <p>*I can speak Haitian Creole and English fluently as well as Spanish and French intermediately</P>
          <p>* I love to eat and try food from different cultures. By far the weirdest food I've tried is frog legs(it's honestly a cross between fish and chicken in taste and in texture) and bacon, egg and cheese flavored crickets from a museum (my friend didnt want to try it alone!)</p>
          <p>*This fellowship has grew my respect for people in tech and who code because this stiuff is tedious, but getting the outcome you want is so worth it</p>

         <h2>School Life </h2>
         <p>*I will be attending St. Josephs college with an major in therapeutic recreation</P>
         <p>*Growing up, I attended an elementary school based around science and technology. They selected me in second grade to learn how to code/program lego robots, set up and fix the projector/smartboards and help the teachers around the school with tech thing. Yes, a little second as tech support! I can say that was the blossoming of my interest in tech</p>
         <p>*Throughout highschool I have taken seven AP courses-Psychology, English Lang and Composition, English Literature, United States History, United States Government and Politics, Calculus, and Computer Science- to get a feel of college level classes. They have been the source of many sleepless nights, but at least now I know what expect and avoid in college</p>
